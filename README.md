# MetaMask/action-publish-gh-pages

This repository can be used on its own but is better used along with: https://github.com/MetaMask/action-publish-release


Add the following Workflow File to your repository in the path `.github/workflows/publish-gh-pages.yml`


## Usage

- the package has a command calld `build`
- `build` should be run before publishing
- no other commands are required before publishing
